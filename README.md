# 2DHE
Two-Dimensional HTML Engine (literally the best name)

Simply a 2D HTML/JS engine I'm working on, hopefully to be the base of other projects in the future.

## About
I've built the engine with multiplayer support since the very beginning. Technically, this doesn't necesarily need to be the case when building off of the engine, its just what I wanted to do the most in terms of an actual game.

I'm mostly just doing this so I have a fun multiplayer game to play with people at my school, lmao.

## General Plans
- Easily extendable, theoretically should be able to make just about anything within some basic confines (such as the nature of the engine, 2D top-down games)
- Fully supporting inventories, items, etc
- Easy HUD/Scoreboard system
- World/mapping system that is easily customizable
- Physics such as collisions
- Velocity/knockback
- As cheat-proof as possible (e.g., movement handled on the server side)
